Lock and Unlock Software
By Jeremy Cueva

Part1.jar is a program that takes in a five digit integer and an input string of random numbers of your choice to say if it is unlocked or locked

part2.jar is the next program that simulates the intruder that doesnt have any idea on how long the access string is so decides to brute force the the program with random string testing. the data being on how long the string is used to get it unlocked

Running the program

Gradle building has been done already so no need to use gradle build

Both programs has been made in Java and is both a jar execute, to execute you would need to make sure the current directory is on folder where the .jar files are placed by using the cd command on your terminal.

then use "java -jar part1.jar" for part one to be tested
and "java -jar part2.jar" for part two to be tested

if you do wish to use gradle
you can run "gradle clean" to "gradle shadowJar"
where clean removes the build file and shadowJar remakes the file
However. Gradle run is unable to make the code run for some unknown reason.

Part 2: 10 tests are done with id of 83918 to ensure that id is same every time

MEMO: I have done this code in java in figuring out mostly on how to randomize part2 strings as well as trying to register the code in 6 digit intervals one by one. The program is made in java and would have mostly my id sample of 83918 to check if they do work, the lock and unlocking code be 4 and 1 respectivly.
